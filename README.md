# Overview

This is a very, very, very minimal implementation of the ancient Clipper programming language.

I've done this so someone I know can enter a solution into the Primes Drag Race.

This is a transpiler from Clipper to Lua, since they map really nicely together.

Python must be installed, as well as a Lua executor, currently no CLI interface as I'm lazy.
